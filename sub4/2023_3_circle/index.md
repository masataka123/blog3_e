# Points on a circle

Let S be the circumference of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1 in Euclid space R^2.
Let a1, a2, ..., an be points on S. 
Prove that there exists a point p on S such that |a1-p| × |a2 - p| × ... × |an - p| = 1. (Here, |a1-p| represents the distance between a1 and p.)
