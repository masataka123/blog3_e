Reference: D. Zagier. "A One-Sentence Proof That Every Prime  p \equiv 1(\mod 4) Is a Sum of Two Squares”. The American Mathematical Monthly, vol. 97, no. 2, 1990, pp. 144–144.

This is the famous [Zagier's one sentence proof](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2323918?seq=1).
I first learned it in an algebra exercise class when I was a third-year student at university.
There is a proof in  [Proofs from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK) .
