## Comment
There is a proof in  [Proofs from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK) .
A great explanation can also be found in this [Ebima Lab' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4V-LblUvLQ) (in Japanese but English subtitles are available).
I think that this Cirno in this video is too smart...
