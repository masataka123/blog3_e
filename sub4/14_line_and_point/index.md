#  Points and Lines
Suppose there are at least two points on the plane, and not all of them lie on a single straight line.
Prove that there exist a line that passes through exactly two of the points.

## Comment
This is the [Sylvester–Gallai theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester–Gallai_theorem)
There is a proof in  [Proofs from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK) .
A great explanation can also be found in this [Ebima Lab' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqpZNCdlYo) (in Japanese but English subtitles are available).
I think that this Cirno in this video is too smart...
