# Kontsevich's puzzle

Imagine an infinite grid of tiles, as in Figure 1 (bottom left). Only the tile at the lower left corner is black, and all the others are white.
Show that, no matter how many times you do the following operation, there will always be a black tile inside the red area in Figure 2 (bottom right).

[Operation]
Choose a black tile whose top tile and right tile are both white. Change this black tile into white, and change the top tile and the right tile into black.

## Comments
This puzzle is based on the Maxim Kontsevich's puzzle in 1981: [Escape of the Clones](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Games/CloneEscape.shtml).
I used this puzzle for our school festival. Even now, this problem is displayed in front of my laboratory.
