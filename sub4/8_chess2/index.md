# Chessboard 2

Consider an 8x8 chessboard.
We place a 1x1 tile anywhere on the chessboard. (See Table 1.)
Show that this chessboard like Table 1 can be filled with the tiles shown in Table 2,  no matter where the 1x1 tile is placed.

Note that the tiles in Table 2 should not overlap and should not protrude each other.
