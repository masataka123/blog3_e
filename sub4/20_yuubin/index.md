## Comment
When I was a PhD student, I worked as a teaching assistant for Prof. [Yusuke Nakamura](https://sites.google.com/site/ynakamuraagmath/home) class.
This problem appeared in an undergraduate exercise. 
I could not solve it at all, but I think some students were able to solve it.

A great explanation can also be found in this [Ebima Lab' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7V-Pw6_w) (in Japanese but English subtitles are available).
