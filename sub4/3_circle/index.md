# Points on a unit circle

Let S be a unit circle, that is, the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin  in Euclid space R^2.
Let a1, a2, ..., an be points on S. 
Prove that there exists a point p on S such that |a1-p| × |a2 - p| × ... × |an - p| = 1. (Here, |a1-p| represents the distance between a1 and p.)

[Shuho Kanda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06893) (the university of Tokyo) told me that  there exists a point p on S such that |a1-p| × |a2 - p| × ... × |an - p| = 2.
