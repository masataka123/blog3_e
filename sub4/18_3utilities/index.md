#  Three utilities problem
Imagine a [mug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug) with this picture on its side:

![](https://masataka123.github.io/blog3/picture/utilities_1.jpg)

This picture shows three houses and three utilities: gas (G), electricity (E), and water (W).
Connect each house to all three utilities with paths that do not cross each other.

[Note] In the picture below, all three houses are connected to gas, but the house on the left is not connected to electricity or water. So this is incorrect.
