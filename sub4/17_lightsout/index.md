# Lights Out game

## Comment

This is also from [Introduction to University Mathematics through Games](https://www.amazon.co.jp/ゲームで大学数学入門-スプラウトからオイラー-ゲッターまで-安田-健彦/dp/4320113446) written by Prof. Yasuda (in Japanese).
In that book, the [Lights Out game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_%28game%29) is studied mathematically.
For n=1,2,3, the matrix can always be turned to the zero matrix by applying the operations. However, for $n=4,5$ there are some examples which cannot be turned to the zero matrix.

The problem above was given as a midterm assignment in [Linear Algebra](https://masataka123.github.io/2022_summer_LA/).
You can see the programming code [here](https://github.com/masataka123/2022_summer_LA/blob/main/material/0_midterm_report_2022s.ipynb) (written in Japanese). It was quite hard work for me...
