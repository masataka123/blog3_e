# **Masataka Iwai**
This is Masataka Iwai's Homepage.
A Japanese version is here.→[日本語版](https://masataka123.github.io/blog3/)

## **Schedule**
- On 20th -- 24th June, 2022,  I will talk in [Workshop on Complex Analysis and Geometry](https://grauert-tubes-2022.esaga.net).
- On 2nd -- 3rd March, 2022,  I will talk in [The hybrid 20th Affine Algebraic Geometry Meeting](http://dubouloz.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Confs/AAG-20-Saitama-2022/index.html).
- On 7th -- 10th February, 2022, we will hold the conference ["Subvarieties and foliations of complex projective varieties"](https://tkoike.com/conf_2021/2022Feb.html). We are looking forward to your participation.

## **Home**
- I'm Masataka Iwai, an assistant professor in Research Alliance Center for Mathematical Sciences, Tohoku University (RACMaS). [Link](http://www.racmas.tohoku.ac.jp/organization.php)
- I'm majoring in complex algebraic geometry and several complex analysis.
- I'm interested in these topics:
1. Structure of morphisms between projective manifolds. I studied relative anti-canonical divisors and relative versions of Fujita's conjecture.
2. Structure of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as ample, nef, big, pseudo-effective). Recently, I studied the structure of log smooth pairs whose logarithmic tangent bundles are "positive".
3. Structure of projective manifolds whose cotangent bundles are "positive". I'm studying now.
<!--- - I study the structures of complex projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as nef, big, pseudo-effective, and so on) and the morphisms between smooth projective varieties by using singular Hermitian metrics. -->
