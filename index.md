## **News**
- On 26th--30th January 2026, we will hold  the conference [Workshop on Algebraic Geometry and Complex Geometry in Osaka](https://masataka123.github.io/AGCG_Osaka_2026/) at Nambu Yoichiro Hall in the University of Osaka. 
- I uploaded a new paper titled [The Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08522) on July 14, 2025. This is a joint work with Satoshi Jinnouchi (Osaka University) and Shiyu Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China, USTC).
- Our joint work with Shin-ichi Matsumura (Tohoku University) and Guolei Zhong (IBS-CCG), titled [Positivity of tangent sheaves of projective varieties -- the structure of MRC fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09489), has been accepted for publication in Algebraic Geometry.

**I do not accept international students unless they are introduced by some professors I know.**
So I do not answer emails asking to be my student. (I receive a lot of such emails.)
We have [an entrance exam](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/inshi/) every year for the Master’s program, so please take the exam.

<!--- - I study the structures of complex projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as nef, big, pseudo-effective, and so on) and the morphisms between smooth projective varieties by using singular Hermitian metrics. -->

## **Information**
- I'm majoring in complex geometry, algebraic geometry, and several complex variables.
- I'm interested in these topics:
1. Structure of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as ample, nef, big, pseudo-effective). 
I established the structure theorem for projective manifolds with "positive" tangent bundles or "positive" foliations.
Recently, I studied the structure of log smooth pairs whose logarithmic tangent bundles are "positive".
2. Structure of projective manifolds whose cotangent bundles are "positive". 
I proved the abundance conjecture for minimal projective manifolds with nef cotangent bundles whose numerical Kodaira dimension is one and I established the structure theorem for this projective manifolds.
3. Second Chern classes and structure theorem.
I established several inequalities involving the second Chern class, such as Miyaoka–Yau-type inequalities, and established the structure theorem when the equality holds.

I also wrote more details on [my staff page](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/staff_iwai.html) in the University of Osaka.
