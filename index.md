- I will talk at [54th summer seminar of Theory of function](https://sites.google.com/view/casummerseminar2019) in 28-30, August, 2019. 
- I will talk at [Young Mathematicians Workshop on Several Complex Variables 2019](http://www.sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~tkoike/2019ymwscv.html)in 7-9, September, 2019. 
- I will talk at "The 62nd symposium on complex analysis", in Daido University in 2-4, November, 2019. 
- I will attend at [The 25th Symposium on Complex Geometry ](https://u-lab.my-pharm.ac.jp/~noda/cnf/kanazawa25.html) in 11-14, November, 2019.

## **Home**
