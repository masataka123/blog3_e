## **Home**
- I'm Masataka Iwai, an assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University. [Link](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/staff.html)
- I'm majoring in complex geometry, algebraic geometry, and several complex variables.
- I'm interested in these topics:
2. Structure of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as ample, nef, big, pseudo-effective). 
I established the structure theorem for projective manifolds with "positive" tangent bundles or "positive" foliations.
Recently, I studied the structure of log smooth pairs whose logarithmic tangent bundles are "positive".
3. Structure of projective manifolds whose cotangent bundles are "positive". 
I proved the abundance conjecture for minimal projective manifolds with nef cotangent bundles whose numerical Kodaira dimension is one and I established the structure theorem for this projective manifolds.

Also, I studied relative anti-canonical divisors and relative versions of Fujita's conjecture.
<!--- - I study the structures of complex projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as nef, big, pseudo-effective, and so on) and the morphisms between smooth projective varieties by using singular Hermitian metrics. -->
