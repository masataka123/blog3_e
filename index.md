## **Schedule**
- From 1st, April, 2022, I am an assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University. [Link](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/staff.html)
- On 20th -- 24th June, 2022,  I will talk in [Workshop on Complex Analysis and Geometry](https://grauert-tubes-2022.esaga.net).

## **Home**
- I'm Masataka Iwai, an assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University. [Link](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/staff.html)
- I'm majoring in complex geometry, algebraic geometry, and several complex variables.
- I'm interested in these topics:
1. Structure of morphisms between projective manifolds. I studied relative anti-canonical divisors and relative versions of Fujita's conjecture.
2. Structure of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as ample, nef, big, pseudo-effective). Recently, I studied the structure of log smooth pairs whose logarithmic tangent bundles are "positive".
3. Structure of projective manifolds whose cotangent bundles are "positive". I'm studying now.
<!--- - I study the structures of complex projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as nef, big, pseudo-effective, and so on) and the morphisms between smooth projective varieties by using singular Hermitian metrics. -->
