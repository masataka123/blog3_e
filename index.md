## **Schedule**
- On 24th May, 2022, I submitted a new preprint. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10613) This is a joint work with Shin-ichi Matsumura.

## **Home**
- I'm Masataka Iwai, an assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University. [Link](http://www.math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/staff.html)
- I'm majoring in complex geometry, algebraic geometry, and several complex variables.
- I'm interested in these topics:
1. Structure of morphisms between projective manifolds. I studied relative anti-canonical divisors and relative versions of Fujita's conjecture.
2. Structure of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as ample, nef, big, pseudo-effective). 
I established the structure theorem for "positive" tangent bundles and "positive" foliations.
Recently, I studied the structure of log smooth pairs whose logarithmic tangent bundles are "positive".
3. Structure of projective manifolds whose cotangent bundles are "positive". 
I proved the abundance conjecture for minimal projective manifolds with nef cotangent bundles whose numerical Kodaira dimension is one and we established the structure theorem for this projective manifolds.
<!--- - I study the structures of complex projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are "positive" (such as nef, big, pseudo-effective, and so on) and the morphisms between smooth projective varieties by using singular Hermitian metrics. -->
